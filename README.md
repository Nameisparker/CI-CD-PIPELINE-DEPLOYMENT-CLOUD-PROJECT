# ABSTRACT 

The rapid growth of cloud computing has revolutionized the way software is developed, deployed and managed. In this context, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines have become crucial for organizations looking to streamline their software delivery processes. This research paper presents a comprehensive study of implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline for an application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The paper focuses on the different components of a CI/CD pipeline, including source code management, build and test, and deployment. The authors explore the various AWS services that can be used to automate these steps, such as GitHub, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline. Furthermore, the paper highlights the benefits of using AWS to create a CI/CD pipeline, such as increased speed, reduced errors, and improved collaboration. The paper concludes with a case study demonstrating how a complete CI/CD pipeline can be created using AWS, providing insights and recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach[1].
